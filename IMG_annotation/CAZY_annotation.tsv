CBM13	pfam00652	CBM	Previously known as cellulose-binding domain family XIII (CBD XIII).	Modules of approx. 150 residues which always appear as a threefold internal repeat. The only apparent exception to this, xylanase II of Actinomadura sp. FC7 (GenBank U08894), is in fact not completely sequenced. These modules were first identified in several plant lectins such as ricin or agglutinin of Ricinus communis which bind galactose residues. The three-dimensional structure of a plant lectin has been determined and displays a pseudo-threefold symmetry in accord with the observed sequence threefold repeat. These modules have since been found in a number of other proteins of various functions including glycoside hydrolases and glycosyltransferases. While in the plant lectins this module binds mannose, binding to xylan has been demonstrated in the Streptomyces lividans xylanase A and arabinofuranosidase B. Binding to GalNAc has been shown for the corresponding module of GalNAc transferase 4. For the other proteins, the binding specificity of these modules has not been established. The pseudo three-fold symmetry of the CBM13 module has now been confirmed in the 3-D structure of the intact, two-domain, xylanase of Streptomyces olivaceoviridis.

GH7	pfam00840	GH	formerly known as cellulase family C. The cellobiohydrolases of this family act processively from the reducing ends of cellulose chains to generate cellobiose.

The structure and mode of action of these enzymes are certainly non-canonical and they cannot be considered as bona fide glycosidases. However, they are kept in the CAZy classification on the basis of their capacity to enhance the breakdown of lignocellulose when used in conjunction with a cellulase or a mixture of cellulases.	endoglucanase (EC 3.2.1.4)

GH48	pfam02011	GH	formerly known as cellulase family L. Some cellobiohydrolases of this family have been reported to act from the reducing ends of cellulose (EC 3.2.1.-), while others have been reported to operate from the non-reducing ends to liberate cellobiose or cellotriose or cellotetraose (EC 3.2.1.-). This family also contains endo-processive cellulases (EC 3.2.1.-), whose activity is hard to distinguish from that of cellobiohydrolases.	endoglucanase (EC 3.2.1.4); chitinase (EC 3.2.1.14); cellobiohydrolase (EC 3.2.1.91); endo-processive cellulases (EC 3.2.1.-); [reducing end] cellobiohydrolase (3.2.1.-)
